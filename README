MacRubyLyrics

This little app gets lyrics from LyricWiki via their JSON API, loads the full lyrics in a WebView and uses JavaScript to extract them.
They are then displayed in a TextView and read to you using NSSpeechSynthesizer.

It's a demo project that is meant to serve as a simple demonstration of the power of MacRuby by combining Cocoa and Ruby features.
